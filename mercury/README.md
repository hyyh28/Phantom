# Mercury

## Overview

This library contains the core core mechanisms for simulating P2P messaging
networks. It is all built on `networkx` primitives and enforces strict
observability constraints as a first-class feature.

## Installation

To use this library, clone the repo, install the requirements and use the
`setup.py` as you would any other project. For example, one can install a local
development version for rapid use,

```console
foo@bar:~$ clone https://git-codecommit.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/mercury-core
foo@bar:~$ cd mercury-core
foo@bar:~$ make init
foo@bar:~$ make dev
```
